### Acknowledgement

Part of this code is from an implementation of 2D Morphological Network CNN by [ranjanZ](https://github.com/ranjanZ/2D-Morphological-Network).

You can get the dataset from our [HSI-Traditional-to-Deep-Models](https://github.com/AnkurDeria/HSI-Traditional-to-Deep-Models) repository(don't forget to give a star). Put the dataset folder in the root directory before running the notebook.
